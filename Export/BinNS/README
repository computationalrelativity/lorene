1/ Description of the various codes
   ================================

read_bin_ns: code for reading a binary file containing data from a spectral computation
             with Lorene and exporting all the fields on a Cartesian grid

2/ Compilation
   ===========

Typing

	make

will produce the executable read_bin_ns in a non-optimized version for
debugging purposes. To get an optimized version for production purposes
type instead

	make -f Makefile_O2

You can clear everything by

	make uninstall


3/ Input parameters
   ================

The code read_bin_ns needs one input file:

read_bin_ns.par :  parameters of the Cartesian grid and name of the spectral data file

The spectral data files resulting from Lorene computations can be downloaded from the
CVS repository of the EU Network "Sources of gravitational radiation", in the module
Meudon/Data/BinNS. See

        http://www.eu-network.org/Projects/InitialData.html

4/ Running
   =======

Simply type

	read_bin_ns

The output files are:

        inib.d : data on the Cartesian grid in a binary format; can be used as input in
                 the constructor Bin_NS::Bin_NS(FILE* ) for further processing

        inif.d : data on the Cartesian grid in a formatted format; can be used as input in
                 the constructor Bin_NS::Bin_NS(ifstream& ) for further processing
